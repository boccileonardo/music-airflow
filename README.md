Personal project
Use Airflow to collect liked and recently played songs in the music platforms I use (yt music and deezer) from last.fm and have a recommender system that supports various modes (favorites, discover new, etc.) in a streamlit api.

Quickstart:
```sh
chmod +x ./scripts/install-airflow.sh
./scripts/install-airflow.sh

chmod +x ./scripts/start-airflow.sh
./scripts/start-airflow.sh
```
